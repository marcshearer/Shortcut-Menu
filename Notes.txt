There seems to be a bug where drop (not insert) is not working on iOS

To switch between Development and Production need to set 
    1. MyApp.expectedDatabase in MyApp.swift
    2. com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment key in entitlements

Seem to need to have an Assets.xcassets at base level just to archive the iOS build

To distribute Mac version, just archive Shortcut Menu Mac. The Copy it and move to apps directory.
    TestFlight doesn't work as blocks hot keys


================================
If everything goes badly wrong

In MyApp.swift replace the backup with a restore (find location by searching for existing one in comment)
Comment out rest of function
Run and wait for 5 mins.
Then stop that version, revert MyApp.swift and re-run

================================
To add a new column to a synchronised table you also need to create it on CloudKit (with CD_ prefix) and make it Queryable and Sortable

To add a new table you also need to create it on CloudKit (with CD_ prefix)
Also make modifiedTimestamp Queryable and Sortable
Also add a CD_entityName column which is Queryable, Sortable and Searchable

Do the above on Development and then Deploy Schema Changes
