There seems to be a bug where drop (not insert) is not working on iOS

To switch between Development and Production need to set 
    1. MyApp.expectedDatabase in MyApp.swift
    2. com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment key in entitlements

Seem to need to have an Assets.xcassets at base level just to archive the iOS build

To distribute Mac version, just archive Shortcut Menu Mac. The Copy it and move to apps directory.
    TestFlight doesn't work as blocks hot keys
