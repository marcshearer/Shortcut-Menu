There seems to be a bug where drop (not insert) is not working on iOS

To switch between Development and Production need to set 
    1. MyApp.expectedDatabase in Declarations
    2. com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment key in entitlements

Seem to need to have an Assets.xcassets at base level just to archive the iOS build
